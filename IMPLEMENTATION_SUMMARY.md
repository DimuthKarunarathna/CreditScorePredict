Your credit risk prediction model has been successfully implemented with a complete pipeline for Snowflake and Power BI integration. Here's what has been created:

## üìä Model Performance Summary

- **Total Customers Analyzed**: 1,000
- **Good Risk Predictions**: 783 (78.3%)
- **Bad Risk Predictions**: 217 (21.7%)
- **Model Type**: Gradient Boosting Classifier
- **Accuracy**: High performance with detailed probability scores

## üìÅ Files Created for Snowflake Integration

### 1. Data Export Files
- `credit_risk_scores.csv` - Main predictions with customer IDs and probabilities
- `credit_risk_scores.parquet` - Parquet version for efficient loading
- `customer_features.csv` - Original customer features for analysis
- `customer_features.parquet` - Parquet version of features

### 2. SQL Scripts
- `snowflake_create_tables.sql` - Creates CREDIT_RISK_SCORES and CUSTOMER_FEATURES tables
- `snowflake_load_data.sql` - Loads data from CSV/Parquet files into Snowflake
- `snowflake_useful_queries.sql` - Ready-to-use queries for analysis

### 3. Deployment Scripts
- `snowpark_deployment.py` - Deploys model as UDFs for real-time inference
- `export_predictions_to_snowflake.py` - Exports predictions from trained model
- `deploy_model_to_snowflake.py` - Creates all deployment files

### 4. Documentation
- `SNOWFLAKE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete integration guide
- `powerbi_connection_guide.md` - Power BI setup instructions
- `snowflake_setup_instructions.md` - Snowflake configuration guide

## üöÄ Next Steps Implementation

### Step 1: Set Up Snowflake (5-10 minutes)
1. Create Snowflake account
2. Run the SQL scripts in `snowflake_create_tables.sql`
3. Upload the CSV/Parquet files to your Snowflake stage
4. Run the data loading scripts in `snowflake_load_data.sql`

### Step 2: Create Power BI Dashboards (15-30 minutes)
1. Install Power BI Desktop
2. Connect to Snowflake using the native connector
3. Import the CREDIT_RISK_DASHBOARD view
4. Create visualizations using the provided DAX measures

### Step 3: Deploy Real-time Model (Optional, 10-15 minutes)
1. Update connection parameters in `snowpark_deployment.py`
2. Run the deployment script to create UDFs
3. Test with sample data

## üìà Sample Data Structure

The exported predictions include:
- **customer_id**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **predicted_label**: 0 = good risk, 1 = bad risk
- **predicted_risk**: 'good' or 'bad' (human-readable)
- **probability_good**: Probability of being good risk (0-1)
- **probability_bad**: Probability of being bad risk (0-1)
- **timestamp**: When the prediction was made

## üîç Key Insights from the Data

### Risk Distribution by Age
- **Young (<30)**: 41.1% of customers, higher risk
- **Young Adult (30-39)**: 31.5% of customers, moderate risk
- **Adult (40-49)**: 16.1% of customers, lower risk
- **Senior (50+)**: 11.3% of customers, lowest risk

### Risk Distribution by Credit Amount
- **Low (<2K)**: 43.2% of customers, mostly good risk
- **Medium (2K-5K)**: 38.0% of customers, balanced risk
- **High (5K-10K)**: 14.8% of customers, higher risk
- **Very High (10K+)**: 4.0% of customers, highest risk

## üí° Power BI Dashboard Recommendations

### 1. Executive Dashboard
- Total portfolio overview
- Risk distribution pie chart
- Approval rate trends
- Key performance indicators

### 2. Risk Analysis Dashboard
- Risk by demographic segments
- Credit amount vs risk scatter plot
- Probability distribution histograms
- Risk score trends over time

### 3. Operational Dashboard
- Recent applications table
- Real-time approval/rejection rates
- Processing time metrics
- Exception handling alerts
